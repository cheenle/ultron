## Description

ULTRON is a sophisticated software tool designed for **remotely or locally controlling programs like JTDX, MSHV, and WSJT-X**. It offers seamless operation on both **Windows and Linux platforms**, supporting both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. The software relies on the **latest version of PHP** for optimal performance.

## Advantages of Using ULTRON

ULTRON offers a multitude of advantages as a **BOT** for controlling programs like JTDX, MSHV, and WSJT-X:

1. **Effortless Remote Control**: ULTRON empowers users with the ability to control radio programs remotely, eliminating the need for physical presence. This is particularly beneficial for scenarios where real-time adjustments and monitoring are required without being tied to a specific location.

2. **Enhanced Efficiency**: By automating repetitive tasks such as CQ calling and message recognition, ULTRON boosts operational efficiency. It can tirelessly manage communication, freeing up operators to focus on more strategic aspects of their radio activities.

3. **Seamless Integration**: ULTRON integrates seamlessly with both Windows and Linux platforms, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience across different operating systems. Its support for various versions ensures compatibility with a wide range of setups.

4. **Real-Time Adaptability**: The real-time functionality of ULTRON enables dynamic changes in software preferences without the need for frequent restarts. Users can switch between programs like JTDX, MSHV, and WSJT-X effortlessly, adapting to changing communication needs on the fly.

5. **Automated Logbook Management**: ULTRON's dedicated logbook management ensures accurate tracking of QSOs. The ability to use a personalized logbook while keeping it separate from other software simplifies record-keeping and QSO verification.

6. **Intelligent Decision-Making**: ULTRON's ability to identify messages, respond to correspondents, and manage waitlists demonstrates its intelligence in making informed decisions during communication. It streamlines the QSO process, increasing the chances of successful interactions.

7. **Signal Strength Assessment**: ULTRON's consideration of signal strength enhances QSO success rates. By taking into account signals weaker than -20dB, it assists in prioritizing communications with better chances of success.

8. **Visual Feedback**: For Raspberry Pi users, the LED control and audible tone features provide visual and audio feedback, enhancing user awareness of ongoing operations and the status of the communication process.

In summary, employing ULTRON as a BOT for radio program control offers an array of benefits, ranging from operational efficiency and adaptability to intelligent decision-making and enhanced communication success rates. Its seamless integration, real-time capabilities, and intelligent automation make ULTRON a valuable asset in the world of amateur radio communication.

## Requirements

### PHP Version Requirements
- Latest version of **PHP** installed
- List of required **PHP modules** (specified at the end of the script)
- Properly configured radio software for optimal performance

### Python Version Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Network permissions for UDP communication
- Terminal with ANSI color support (recommended)

### General Recommendations for Optimal Usage:
- Disable the Tx watchdog
- Configure the UDP server to target the program's IP location
- Enable transmission of logged QSO ADIF data
- Do not filter UDP data
- Adjust firewall settings to facilitate data flow
- For DXCC features: ensure `base.json` and `dxcc_config` files are properly configured

## 📋 Details

- ULTRON operates in **real-time**, allowing seamless software switches without requiring restarts. It automatically detects your **call sign**, **IP address**, and communication ports.
- ULTRON uses its own **logbook**, but you can provide your own by placing it in the "**wsjtx_log.adi**" folder within ULTRON. This logbook remains separate from other software.
- In addition to calling CQ, ULTRON recognizes messages like **73** / **RRR** or **RR73** and determines if correspondents are busy or unresponsive.
- If a correspondent doesn't respond, they will be **waitlisted for 30 minutes** before a QSO retry.
- Signals weaker than **-20dB** are considered less likely to result in successful QSOs.
- The logged ADIF message is sent to ULTRON when the WSJT-X user accepts the "Log  QSO" dialog by clicking the "OK" button.

## Terminal and Color Support

ULTRON requires a terminal with **ASCII color support**. You can use the **Linux terminal** or the new **Windows 10/11 terminal**, both of which support ASCII color. For color support on Windows, consider using [**ConEmu**](https://conemu.github.io/) for an enhanced experience.

## Raspberry Pi

To control Raspberry Pi LEDs, use the `sudo` command configured without a password prompt. The **green LED** lights up for each decoding and turns off when inactive. The **red LED** exhibits a heartbeat-like effect during QSOs. Conducting a QSO emits an audible tone if a speaker is connected to the Pi's jack.

```bash
# Clone or download ULTRON
git clone https://github.com/lu9dce/ultron.git
cd ultron

# Check your radio software (JTDX/WSJT-X/MSHV):
# - Enable UDP server on port 2237
# - Disable TX watchdog
# - Enable ADIF logging
```

### 3. Configure DXCC (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
# Analyze your current DXCC status
python dxcc_analyzer.py    # Python version

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**🔴 Port 2237 Already in Use**
```bash
# Find process using port
sudo lsof -i :2237
# Kill process if needed
sudo kill -9 [PID]
```

**🔴 No UDP Data Received**
- Check JTDX/WSJT-X UDP settings (port 2237)
- Verify firewall allows UDP traffic
- Ensure "Enable UDP" is checked in radio software

**🔴 DXCC Not Working**
- Verify `base.json` exists and is valid
- Check `dxcc_config` file syntax
- Run analyzer to test DXCC data loading

**🔴 Python Version Won't Start**
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version  # Need 3.7+
# Install if needed dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**🔴 PHP Version Errors**
- Verify PHP with sockets extension: `php -m | grep sockets`
- Check platform-specific php.ini in `extra/` folder
- Ensure proper file permissions

### Performance Optimization

**For Better DXCC Performance:**
- Keep `base.json` updated with current DXCC data
- Use `worked_dxcc_cache.json` to avoid re-analysis
- Configure band-specific whitelists for targeted operation

**For Network Performance:**
- Use wired connection when possible
- Close unnecessary network applications
- Consider running on same machine as JTDX/WSJT-X

Ultron was originally developed by LU9DCE for personal use and friends. The original version requires knowledge of PHP and terminal usage. The original author guarantees it works very well and can operate for years without intervention.

**Why the Original PHP Version?** Because it runs on any operating system without compilation. The script is just text with commands that executes on any device capable of running PHP (PC/CELLPHONE/ROUTER/etc).

**Enhanced Version Philosophy:**
This enhanced version respects the original design principles while adding:
- **Modern Python alternative** for better cross-platform support
- **Enhanced DXCC capabilities** for more effective DX hunting
- **Improved documentation** for easier adoption
- **Active development** for ongoing feature additions
- **Backward compatibility** with original PHP implementation

We maintain the original's reliability while extending its capabilities for modern amateur radio operations.
